/* Functionality Specification:
 * - `from_caller` holds the information from the caller sent to the callee.
 *   It is set in `prepare_for_call` and consumed in `start_enter()` or cleared in `finalize_call`.
 * - `from_callee` holds the return information, not necessarily the expected function's (look at external functions).
 */
/* How are external function calls detected/handled?
 * (internal = instrumented, external = not instrumented)
 * It is important to consider both scenarios where an external function is in the programs call stack.
 * 1. When the external function is called from an internal one.
 * 2. When the external function calls an internal one.
 *
 * Detection is mainly done by setting a function id on the caller side and comparing it with
 * the current function id on the callee side.
 * However, following some scenarios below, you can have cases that the id is not checked at all that
 * can also be used to deduce the presence of external functions.
 * Specification:
 * - Using `from_caller.expected_func` to store the information.
 * - `latest_call_sanity` is stack-based data meant for the caller. It is set when
 *    an internal function is called, otherwise remains unset or is set to false.
 * Scenarios:
 * - internal -> external:
 *   When returned to the caller, `latest_call_sanity` is unset, `from_caller` is unconsumed.
 * - external -> internal:
 *   When entered the callee, `from_caller` is not available.
 * - internal -> external -> internal
 *   When entered the internal callee, `from_caller.expected_func` does not match.
 *   `latest_call_sanity` is set.
 * - internal -> external -> internal+
 *   When entered the first internal callee, same as above.
 *   When entered the second internal callee, `from_caller` is not available, but `from_callee` is available.
 *   When returned to the initial caller, `from_callee` from the latest internal callee is not consumed.
 * - internal -> drop -> internal
 *   (Temporarily unsupported by instrumentation)
 *   When entered the internal callee, `from_caller` is not available.
 *   When returned to the caller, `from_callee` is not consumed, but no finalization is performed either.
